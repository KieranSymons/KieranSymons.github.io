<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am an avid sportsman who is currently engaged in both the bachelors of IT (part time) and an electrical apprenticeship <br>
(part time education, full time work). I have attempted university before with varying levels of success and interest <br>
before deciding to get a qualification while working to be in a better position at the end of my education. There is a <br>
two-year gap in my education where I was able to secure a contract to play and coach field hockey in the UK for those years,<br> 
it was a tremendous experience with many opportunities for travel given to me, coaching/playing experience in a high-quality <br>
league and I cannot imagine not having been able to do so. Despite feeling behind in my life plans with so much wasted time, <br>
I could not think of another way I’d have done it to be the person I am today.<br>
</p>
<h3>My Interest in IT</h3>
<p>
My interest in IT is very much as an outside observer of the industry and as a consumer if IT related products. I am expecting <br>
that through the completion of this course, I will develop a more nuanced view of the industry, where my place is within it <br>
and be able to further, and expand, my career into the juggernaut that is information technology.<br>
<br>
I have always been drawn to tech, from a young age my parents were using computers regularly and their interest followed on to <br>
myself. There was a dramatic up tick in my interest in IT when I began to get involved with video games. One of my most vivid <br>
childhood memories is playing and replaying the demo CD that came out of a Nutri-grain cereal box for the very first Age of <br>
Empires game. From there the next major jump in my involvement occurred when I broke my leg at the age of 16, I had a friend I <br>
would regularly play PC games with as he had two computers, and at that point I spent the better part of 6 weeks gradually <br>
becoming more and more involved in a clan based competitive experience in a well-known first-person shooter, Call of Duty. From <br>
there I began being influenced by new and exciting tech and gadgets, from a laptop-tablet combo to the new Google Assistant Nest <br>
products, I always keep an eye on the new and exciting expansions to the gadget sphere.<br>
<br>
I have chosen RMIT as the place to undergo some formal training in the IT industry as I have attended the university previously <br>
in other training. I find the institution to be of a high quality with far reaching contacts and facilities, and their online <br>
course option was the perfect fit for my current situation.<br>

<img src="https://github.com/KieranSymons/KieranSymons.github.io/blob/main/JobApp1.png">
</p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
The role of a <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/network-engineer">Network Engineer</a> is to design, maintain and construct the connected network of systems used by persons, businesses <br>
and organizations. Their goal is to create an efficient and robust system that will stand the rigors of use and be an asset to the <br>
successful functioning of the client.<br>
</p>
<h4>Personal Appeal</h4>
<p>
This job role appeals to me as from a creative sense, the problem solving, adaptation and physical nature of creating something like <br>
a network gives me great fulfillment. In my present role as an electrician, I can see the growing space that is going to require <br>
networks, from the Internet-of-Things to home automation and expanding need for robust and secure home/business networks. Being able <br>
to tie in my hands on experience in construction and installation with the necessary training and intellectual ability that the design <br>
of these networks requires appeals to me greatly.<br>
</p>
<h4>Qualifications</h4>
<h5><a href="https://www.roberthalf.com.au/employers/it-technology/network-engineer-jobs"> Job Requisite (Robert Half, 2021)</a></h5>
<p>
A technical background or formal qualification are required for persons entering this role. Some examples include:<br>
-	Bachelor of; Computer science, information systems, computer systems or network engineering, electrical or electronic engineering, <br>
	mathematics or physics and network or cyber security.<br>
-	Technical experience in; computer systems and networks, data installation, network maintenance.<br>

-	Communication skills<br>
-	Technologically fluent<br>
-	Fast learner<br>
</p>
<h5>Currently Held</h5>
<p>
I believe I hold many of the traits that are needed for this role. I am able to problem solve and learn quickly, I am able to learn new <br>
skills and technologies quickly, I am a good communicator having worked and competed in teams many times. My areas for improvement in <br>
these non-quantifiable traits are time and workflow management, however I am actively continuing to develop this.<br>
<br>
I believe that this course and its association with the Bachelor of IT will bring me close to getting the required formal qualifications <br>
necessary for this role. As I am exposed to new areas of the IT sphere, I will specialize and if need be, switch to a more targeted <br>
degree such as systems or Electrical Engineering.<br>
<br>
As I am currently employed the work, I do occasionally overlap to the IT sphere, and I have experience in troubleshooting and installing <br>
data infrastructure, security and CCTV systems and Access Control. Continuing to build on this knowledge is a significant goal and will <br>
give me exposure to the required general experience that a lot of roles ask for.<br>
<h2>Personality Profile</h2>
<h3>Meyers-Briggs Test (NERIS Analytics Limited, 2021)</h3>
<p>
Undertaking the Meyers-Briggs Test found at www.16personalities.com, I was found to be of the “Debater” personality type. According to<br> 
this test, debaters enjoy high level problem solving and understanding problems or positions from multiple perspectives. An important part<br>
of the debater’s interaction within a team and their willingness and ability to play the devil’s advocate role in discussions.<br>
</p>
<h3>What’s your learning style? (PHEAA, 2021)</h3>
<p>
According to the learning style questionnaire facilitated at www.educationplanner.org, I am a visual learner. The positive traits of a <br>
visual learner are that they are able to visualize tasks and learning material as it is being learned, visual learners learn best from visual<br>
mediums. This could be books, film or hands on experience and tutorials. “Visual learners are attracted to color and spoken language that is <br>
rich in imagery” (PHEAA, 2021).<br>
</p>
<h3>Honesty Test (Psychologies, 2020)</h3>
<p>
The online quiz found at www.psychologies.co.uk/tests asks the user to respond to hypothetical scenarios in which you need to choose an<br> 
appropriate action. The end result of this quiz was an affirmation of how I feel; that I hate to lie. It does raise the issue of persons like<br> 
myself, that although honesty is often the best policy, such a stringent adherence to this belief can make the subtler points of group <br>
diplomacy hard.<br>
</p>
<h3>What does this mean?</h3>
<p>
When taking tests, the first response is an interesting one. Occasionally one can feel like the result is completely out of line with your <br>
understanding of yourself, or conversely, it can feel like the test has read into your soul. Being able to look at the result subjectively and<br>
with a grain of salt, can allow improvement in your work and interactions by having a deeper understanding of how best you can act for <br>
success.<br>
<br>
Knowing my results will change how I put forth my strengths and weaknesses in the team setting. It is easy to put forward an ill matched role <br>
due to pride or eagerness, however for the best possible outcome for all involved a clear view of the strengths, weaknesses, habits, and <br>
personalities of team members is crucial to development of and interaction within, the team. It is worth mentioning that the views of the rest <br>
of the team are important in this as all the tests preceding this are not considered factual and inescapably accurate. Holding on to one <br>
perspective is no better than having none. It is a known effect of people’s inclination to bend their true response towards one that would lead <br>
to a more favorable result discrediting the validity of these test further.<br>
<br>
Cohesion and communication form the basis of good teams, and to make the most of the available resources it can be important to assemble a team <br>
that is well rounded and to be aware of potential personality clashes. When the options are available, choosing persons who are honest, with <br>
integrity and are willing to take responsibility for their work and actions, will create a positive, driven atmosphere.<br>
</p>
<h2>Project Idea - Electrical Trade Inventory and Stock Management System</h2>
<p>
The implementation of an inventory management system with the ability to confirm stock levels, track usage and order directly from suppliers to <br>
increase efficiency and minimize wastage. In the construction industry, especially small to medium sized businesses, it is not uncommon for the <br>
businesses to maintain stock at a central warehouse, however they are not large enough to warrant maintaining a member of staff devoted to <br>
inventory and stock acquisition. This job is often performed spontaneously or part-time by an employee across multiple job roles.<br>
</p>
<h3>Project Motivation</h3>
<p>
The motivation for creating such a system is originally based purely on anecdotal evidence and personal experience. In my own company, there is <br>
a large build up of stock at our warehouse, with items and accessories that have become obsolete due to not being used within their appropriate <br>
time period. The process for ordering material and products to jobs is currently done by emailing another employee who then orders the products <br>
based on the description of them in the email. This process could be much cleaner and efficient, and it is a obvious IT solution.<br>
</p>
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>
A system that consists of a central data base and computer-based user interface, the scanning and logging of inventory items that are registered <br>
with custom barcodes for internal use. The system should hold a register of allowed users with associated unique user accounts, ask users to log <br>
in to maintain security and keep a log of actions in case of fraudulent behavior. A significant addition would be the expansion to include a <br>
mobile app that would allow persons in the field to order stock from the warehouse as needed.<br>
<br>
The system should have administrator functions and data tracking to facilitate decision making and analysis of trends in stock requirements. In <br>
the ideal scenario, items are scanned out for delivery and associated with ongoing projects, with any unused stock returned and scanned back into <br>
the warehouse. With this system in place, the project will have an accurate gauge of how much of what stock is used which can in turn be used to <br>
improve the quoting of future jobs based on past data.<br>
<br>
The use of a mobile app that can be uploaded to company or private devices will allow the utilization of on-site time for ordering and stock checks. <br>
The ability to directly choose items rather than running the list through to a third party will minimize ordering errors and place the responsibility <br>
of getting it right on the leading hand.<br>
<br>
The system should allow uploading and updating of products with the appropriate links to preferred suppliers (also updateable) to automate the <br>
acquisition of products from suppliers and keep a record of purchases for leverage in mediating discounts. Accurate and recent data is essential in <br>
this.<br>
<br>
Ongoing support for this project would be needed with many expansion opportunities present. Some updates to the project could be: a rostering <br>
function, a project management function, a timesheet/wage function, an invoicing function, a estimating function, an accounting function and a full <br>
statistical/overview function.<br>
</p>
<h3>Development and Requirements</h3>
<p>
A significant portion of the development of the project is software. Programming a system that is secure and reliable with the ability to be accessed <br>
remotely using a major language. A central server with an associated computer for direct user interface. Connection to a barcode scanner, the <br>
internet (accessing suppliers), a packaging array for sending out the required stock.<br>
<br>
For the installation of the project, electrician hand and power tools are capable of the install. This includes pliers, screwdrivers, data punches, <br>
cable strippers, power drill, impact driver. For accessories; RJ45 data mechs for connection to internal server, a data rack, Ethernet switch (POE), <br>
local memory within the server for the program and stock objects.<br>
<br>
Installation of the system will not be a hard skill to find as the company is involved with installs similar to this. The programming of the system<br> 
will be more challenging as finding the correct person is important to the end quality of the project and a discussion will need to be had to find <br>
the best language for the program. A user interface designer to create an easily accessible program. This could be the same programmer. Many of the <br>
tools required are already on hand as they are required for the company’s operation, and the technologies and accessories required exist and are <br>
available from suppliers that are already within contact.<br>
</p>
<h3>Expected Outcomes</h3>
<p>
If the project is successful, there will be a marked increase in the efficiency of the process for ordering and receiving stock, a decrease in the <br>
wastage and accumulation of excess stock in the warehouse, and a decrease in the amount of man hours spent ordering and maintaining the inventory <br>
as the process currently stands. By automating the process of stock acquisition, more time can be spent pursuing the true business goals and using <br>
the data the project could provide, efficiencies will be seen across the company.<br>
