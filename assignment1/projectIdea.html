<title>Project Idea - Electrical Trade Inventory and Stock Management System</title>
</head>
<body>
<img src="warehouse.png" alt="Generic Warehouse Stock">
<h1>Outline</h1>
<p>
The implementation of an inventory management system with the ability to confirm stock levels, track usage and order directly from suppliers to <br>
increase efficiency and minimize wastage. In the construction industry, especially small to medium sized businesses, it is not uncommon for the <br>
businesses to maintain stock at a central warehouse, however they are not large enough to warrant maintaining a member of staff devoted to <br>
inventory and stock acquisition. This job is often performed spontaneously or part-time by an employee across multiple job roles.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h1>Project Motivation</h1>
<p>
The motivation for creating such a system is originally based purely on anecdotal evidence and personal experience. In my own company, there is <br>
a large build up of stock at our warehouse, with items and accessories that have become obsolete due to not being used within their appropriate <br>
time period. The process for ordering material and products to jobs is currently done by emailing another employee who then orders the products <br>
based on the description of them in the email. This process could be much cleaner and efficient, and it is a obvious IT solution.<br>
</p>

<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>
A system that consists of a central data base and computer-based user interface, the scanning and logging of inventory items that are registered <br>
with custom barcodes for internal use. The system should hold a register of allowed users with associated unique user accounts, ask users to log <br>
in to maintain security and keep a log of actions in case of fraudulent behavior. A significant addition would be the expansion to include a <br>
mobile app that would allow persons in the field to order stock from the warehouse as needed.<br>
<br>
The system should have administrator functions and data tracking to facilitate decision making and analysis of trends in stock requirements. In <br>
the ideal scenario, items are scanned out for delivery and associated with ongoing projects, with any unused stock returned and scanned back into <br>
the warehouse. With this system in place, the project will have an accurate gauge of how much of what stock is used which can in turn be used to <br>
improve the quoting of future jobs based on past data.<br>
<br>
The use of a mobile app that can be uploaded to company or private devices will allow the utilization of on-site time for ordering and stock checks. <br>
The ability to directly choose items rather than running the list through to a third party will minimize ordering errors and place the responsibility <br>
of getting it right on the leading hand.<br>
<br>
The system should allow uploading and updating of products with the appropriate links to preferred suppliers (also updateable) to automate the <br>
acquisition of products from suppliers and keep a record of purchases for leverage in mediating discounts. Accurate and recent data is essential in <br>
this.<br>
<br>
Ongoing support for this project would be needed with many expansion opportunities present. Some updates to the project could be: a rostering <br>
function, a project management function, a timesheet/wage function, an invoicing function, a estimating function, an accounting function and a full <br>
statistical/overview function.<br>
</p>

<h1>Development and Requirements</h1>
<p>
A significant portion of the development of the project is software. Programming a system that is secure and reliable with the ability to be accessed <br>
remotely using a major language. A central server with an associated computer for direct user interface. Connection to a barcode scanner, the <br>
internet (accessing suppliers), a packaging array for sending out the required stock.<br>
<br>
For the installation of the project, electrician hand and power tools are capable of the install. This includes pliers, screwdrivers, data punches, <br>
cable strippers, power drill, impact driver. For accessories; RJ45 data mechs for connection to internal server, a data rack, Ethernet switch (POE), <br>
local memory within the server for the program and stock objects.<br>
<br>
Installation of the system will not be a hard skill to find as the company is involved with installs similar to this. The programming of the system<br> 
will be more challenging as finding the correct person is important to the end quality of the project and a discussion will need to be had to find <br>
the best language for the program. A user interface designer to create an easily accessible program. This could be the same programmer. Many of the <br>
tools required are already on hand as they are required for the companyâ€™s operation, and the technologies and accessories required exist and are <br>
available from suppliers that are already within contact.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h1>Expected Outcomes</h1>
<p>
If the project is successful, there will be a marked increase in the efficiency of the process for ordering and receiving stock, a decrease in the <br>
wastage and accumulation of excess stock in the warehouse, and a decrease in the amount of man hours spent ordering and maintaining the inventory <br>
as the process currently stands. By automating the process of stock acquisition, more time can be spent pursuing the true business goals and using <br>
the data the project could provide, efficiencies will be seen across the company.<br>
