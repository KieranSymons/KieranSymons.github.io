<h1>Meyers-Briggs Test (NERIS Analytics Limited, 2021)</h1>
<img src="meyersBriggs.png" alt="Debater">
<p>
Undertaking the Meyers-Briggs Test found at www.16personalities.com, I was found to be of the “Debater” personality type. According to<br> 
this test, debaters enjoy high level problem solving and understanding problems or positions from multiple perspectives. An important part<br>
of the debater’s interaction within a team and their willingness and ability to play the devil’s advocate role in discussions.<br>

<h1>What’s your learning style? (PHEAA, 2021)</h1>
<p>
According to the learning style questionnaire facilitated at www.educationplanner.org, I am a visual learner. The positive traits of a <br>
visual learner are that they are able to visualize tasks and learning material as it is being learned, visual learners learn best from visual<br>
mediums. This could be books, film or hands on experience and tutorials. “Visual learners are attracted to color and spoken language that is <br>
rich in imagery” (PHEAA, 2021).<br>

<h1>Honesty Test (Psychologies, 2020)</h1>
<p>
The online quiz found at www.psychologies.co.uk/tests asks the user to respond to hypothetical scenarios in which you need to choose an<br> 
appropriate action. The end result of this quiz was an affirmation of how I feel; that I hate to lie. It does raise the issue of persons like<br> 
myself, that although honesty is often the best policy, such a stringent adherence to this belief can make the subtler points of group <br>
diplomacy hard.<br>

<h1>What does this mean?</h1>
<p>
When taking tests, the first response is an interesting one. Occasionally one can feel like the result is completely out of line with your <br>
understanding of yourself, or conversely, it can feel like the test has read into your soul. Being able to look at the result subjectively and<br>
with a grain of salt, can allow improvement in your work and interactions by having a deeper understanding of how best you can act for <br>
success.<br>
<br>
Knowing my results will change how I put forth my strengths and weaknesses in the team setting. It is easy to put forward an ill matched role <br>
due to pride or eagerness, however for the best possible outcome for all involved a clear view of the strengths, weaknesses, habits, and <br>
personalities of team members is crucial to development of and interaction within, the team. It is worth mentioning that the views of the rest <br>
of the team are important in this as all the tests preceding this are not considered factual and inescapably accurate. Holding on to one <br>
perspective is no better than having none. It is a known effect of people’s inclination to bend their true response towards one that would lead <br>
to a more favorable result discrediting the validity of these test further.<br>
<br>
Cohesion and communication form the basis of good teams, and to make the most of the available resources it can be important to assemble a team <br>
that is well rounded and to be aware of potential personality clashes. When the options are available, choosing persons who are honest, with <br>
integrity and are willing to take responsibility for their work and actions, will create a positive, driven atmosphere.<br>
