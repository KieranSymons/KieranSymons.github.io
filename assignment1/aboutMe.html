  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I am an avid sportsman who is currently engaged in both the bachelors of IT (part time) and an electrical apprenticeship <br>
(part time education, full time work). I have attempted university before with varying levels of success and interest <br>
before deciding to get a qualification while working to be in a better position at the end of my education. There is a <br>
two-year gap in my education where I was able to secure a contract to play and coach field hockey in the UK for those years,<br> 
it was a tremendous experience with many opportunities for travel given to me, coaching/playing experience in a high-quality <br>
league and I cannot imagine not having been able to do so. Despite feeling behind in my life plans with so much wasted time, <br>
I could not think of another way Iâ€™d have done it to be the person I am today.<br>

<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
<p>
My interest in IT is very much as an outside observer of the industry and as a consumer if IT related products. I am expecting <br>
that through the completion of this course, I will develop a more nuanced view of the industry, where my place is within it <br>
and be able to further, and expand, my career into the juggernaut that is information technology.<br>
<br>
I have always been drawn to tech, from a young age my parents were using computers regularly and their interest followed on to <br>
myself. There was a dramatic up tick in my interest in IT when I began to get involved with video games. One of my most vivid <br>
childhood memories is playing and replaying the demo CD that came out of a Nutri-grain cereal box for the very first Age of <br>
Empires game. From there the next major jump in my involvement occurred when I broke my leg at the age of 16, I had a friend I <br>
would regularly play PC games with as he had two computers, and at that point I spent the better part of 6 weeks gradually <br>
becoming more and more involved in a clan based competitive experience in a well-known first-person shooter, Call of Duty. From <br>
there I began being influenced by new and exciting tech and gadgets, from a laptop-tablet combo to the new Google Assistant Nest <br>
products, I always keep an eye on the new and exciting expansions to the gadget sphere.<br>
<br>
I have chosen RMIT as the place to undergo some formal training in the IT industry as I have attended the university previously <br>
in other training. I find the institution to be of a high quality with far reaching contacts and facilities, and their online <br>
course option was the perfect fit for my current situation.<br>
